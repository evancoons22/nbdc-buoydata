Updates that need to be made: 
- remove model2.py, train model from ipynb instead
- change runmodel to insert into remote database
- update main sqlite3 table
    - handle non existing buoys for queries
    - label data
    - impute missing buoys
    - handle queries that don't get anything. Insert na into table if not there
    - end goal: we want complete data for training. Buoys will generally remain the same
    - do I want to go back and fill in NAs if the api for a buoy comes back online?
